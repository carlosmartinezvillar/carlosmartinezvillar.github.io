		<h1>Research</h1>

		<p>My current research focuses on the intersection of convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. Right now I am working on project that focuses on using parsimonious convolutional "encoder-decoder" models like U-Net to measure the change in earth features due to climate change.</p>
		<p>I work out of Dr. Grant Scotts's <a href="https://dataintensive.rnet.missouri.edu/">High-Performance Data-Intensive Computational Systems Lab</a> in the EECS department at the University of Missouri</p>
