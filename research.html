		<h1>Research</h1>

		<p>My present research focuses on the intersection of neural networks for semantic segmentation and remote sensing. The aim of my most recent project is emphasize  convolutional "encoder-decoder" models like U-Net to measure the change in earth features due to climate change.</p>
		<p>I currently work out of Dr. Grant Scotts's <a href="https://scottgs.mufaculty.umsystem.edu/">High-Performance Data-Intensive Computational Systems Lab</a> in the EECS department at the University of Missouri</p>
