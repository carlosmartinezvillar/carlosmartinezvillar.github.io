		<h2>Internal Links/Other "Fun" Stuff</h2>
		<i><b>Note to the incautious reader: </b></i>One of the links below includes my credentials. The rest contain unnecessary amounts of egomaniacal material and unsolicited opinions. Initially this wasn't an exercise of vanity or hubris but rather a self-interested attempt at career development. I began this website as an aspiring academician in hopes it would serve as a curriculum vitae. I have, however, managed to tarnish these pure intentions with some of my thoughts on various subjects. Some could be unpopular, so enter at your own risk.
		<ul>
			<li><a href="research.html">Research</a>: publications, interest, current work, and CV. The usual.</li>
			<!-- <li><a href="weblog.html">Weblog</a>: random assortment of thoughts and divagations where I pontificate on the humane and the divine</li> -->
			<!-- <li><a href="books.html">Booklog</a>: a sort of reading log with a few unsolicited opinions added for good measure</li> -->
			<li><a href="library.html">Library</a>: texts in the public domain, which gives me opportunity to share and read them</li>
			<li><a href="about.html">About me</a>: worst section of this site.</li>
		</ul>
