		<h2>On Peterson</h2>
		<i>18 Apr 2022</i>
		<hr>
		<p>I don't dislike Peterson. This often causes concern among the peers I have had the opportunity to discuss the subject with. I don't think he's a genius, by any means, and I find his digressions annoying, frankly. These same constant digressions are tiresome to listen to for most, so they are usually an arguing point for his fans who fervently claim that people who dislike him are simply not paying enough attention to what he's saying. This could very well be true for some since it seems most people these days can hardly concentrate on one thing for more than 15 seconds. It could simply be uninteresting for others. I've often heard the argument that his too religious, which doesn't mean much since it is obvious that anybody immediately disgusted by the words Christianity or bible won't pay attention to what he says anyways. Beyond all of those barriers to entry into the Peterson market, In don't find him brilliant but I do have an intuition that his heart might be in the right place. It is after all entirely possible that the answer to the question of how to politically organize ourselves is partly a psychological one. History gives us the vantage point of knowing that it is important to consider the idiosincracies of mankind in governing. Their selfishness, jealousy, anger, resentment, hopes, and the whole catalog of passions and impulses that reason has to wrestle with. These are obviously overlapping with the field of psychology. Looking at it differently (and others' politics might be better aligned with this), it is also possible that the correct system of government should be based on assuming the most virtuous behavior of the individual (i.e. ethical). In that case, finding the patterns that build that ethical citizen is just as important, and could also be a two-fold question for psychologists: how to both avoid pathologies that prevent this ideal individual from being created? and how to find mental "paths of least resistance" for behavior that will lead to invidual self-improvement? I don't think that by studying the bible, the guy should immediately become a thumper. He is simply looking at one influential book with these patterns. Is he a conservative? I believe so. Nothing wrong with that, but even if a good argument (not saying mine is) is made in favor of Peterson, being conservative (which I believe he publicly acknowledged) will be enough to turn people away. I find this is comical given that people repulsed by the contrasting political alternative often fail to see that this political alternative is equally repulsed by them. Or as some Matthew guy of last name 7 said, “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?"</p>
