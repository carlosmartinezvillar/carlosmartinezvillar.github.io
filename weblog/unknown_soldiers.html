		<h2>Unknown Soldiers/Soldados Desconocidos</h2>
		<i>15 Apr 2022</i>
		<hr>

		I was left with lingering questions that I very well know will never be answered after learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Unknown_Soldier_(Arlington)">The Tomb of The Unknown Soldier</a>. 
		I'm definitely ill-equipped to produce any value judgement (critique or praise) on the military, so I won't produce it and my questions were certainly not related to the particular <a href="https://youtu.be/4utXb3auOew">ceremony</a> of the US but rather to the surprising contrast between <a href="../images/unknownsoldier.jpg">this memorial</a> and <a href="../images/soldadodesconocidoantesyahora.jpeg">the one in Chile</a>. I won't dare to say the questions I was left with were deep philosophical ones, but they were at the very least sociological and–most likely–psychological in nature.

		There are plenty of videos out there of youngsters being thoroughly yelled at for trespassing near the memorial in Arlington. These are easy to enjoy. Forgive them father for they suffer from youth. Most people, however, seem to be deeply respectful of the place and take it quite seriously. I found it remarkable and curious that this has been guarded uninterruptedly since 07/02/1937 with each guard walking 21 steps, pausing for 21 seconds, turning, and repeating this process until the next guard arrives. In the Chilean case, the unknown soldier memorial was a part of the <a href="../images/baquedanoantes.jpeg">larger memorial</a> with the equastrian statue of the undefeated General Baquedano commemorating the victories in the War of the Pacific. Today, both the equastrian statue and the soldier are <a href="../images/baquedanoantesyahora.jpeg">gone</a>, after being repeatedly defaced for months on end. All of this creates a surrealistically stark contrast. On the one hand, a solemn and widely appreciated living memorial with sentries that must take their job very seriously. On the other, a place that is no longer a memorial, left unattended for human hordes to display their more animal sides in this "present debauchery of our wretched commonwealth"[1].

		<p>Is this a true reflection of the state of the country? What are the psychological phenomena that have to take place in the mind of a country's citizen to give up national pride? Even if someone is particularly touched by national pride, we do live in nation-states that in part sustain themselves by exploting these feelings. What specifics of the social context trigger the incubation and brooding over of this widespread disrespect and hatred? It seems as if this allows for a disgust that later turns into hate, which is then able to reign over any leftover reason that could mediate the evaluation of one's country? If you ask me, this might all be to be unfortunately associated to this new pamphletary wisdom of our times that emphasizes social "justice" over common sense.</p>
