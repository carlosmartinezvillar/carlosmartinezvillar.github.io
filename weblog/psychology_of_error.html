			<h2>Psychology of Error</h2>
			<i>15 Apr 2022</i>
			<hr>

			<p>
			I have been wondering for some time now about the human response to being wrong. For the majority of people, it seems, the most natural reaction to being caught as being wrong in conversation is to become wildly defensive. When presented with a mistake, some might contradict themselves to correct or steer away from their prior, which is essentially a sinuous way of trying to be right (or at least less wrong). People that are noticeably more capable intellectually than the average do this. For others the reaction is often astonishment and surprise, caused perhaps because they were not expecting a refutal to their terms. It seems nonsensical since we spent a good portion of our time inferring things with the possibility of being wrong always present in those inferences. Is this just an instinctual trait we possess as part of the animal kingdom that serves only for assertiveness? In that same line of thought, it seems also entirely possible that is simply a survival instinct we use to defend ourselves against others potentially disliking us in fear that this dislike could eventually turn into aggression. Then there's the other problem of what happens when we make a mistake alone. Our thoughts are obviously not scrutinized as dilligently when we are alone, so perhaps we are constantly lying to ourselves not only to match our idea of our persona and personality, but also to help in the development of our defensive "instinct". I would very much appreciate some guidance on why this happens, ideally with references to sources in the psychology literature on errors/mistakes and/or social behavior concerning these mistakes.
