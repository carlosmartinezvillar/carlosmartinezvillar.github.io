		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>I was born in 1990 in the southern part of Chile (parallel 40º 18' S approximately) in a small towncalled La Unión. There are a lot of <a href="images/rancolake.png">lakes</a> and <a href="images/vacas.jpeg">cows</a>. According to someone's history, the town was started as a small outpost of the fort of Valdivia and later industrialized by the German immigrants that began arriving after the 1840s. After falling from grace, the place became so far removed from the rest of the world the rumor has it that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bormann">Martin Bormann</a>'s doppelganger (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrnoXIott30">perhaps</a> the man himself?) came to hide in the area and overstayed his welcome. Anyways, I left for the United States in my early 20's to study at the University of Missouri and got a few degrees. In 2018 I started graduate school in Computer Science and switched to the PhD program after finding out I don't hate science. I do keep in touch with family and friends back home who, I've noticed, are aging at a noticeably slower pace than me.</p>
